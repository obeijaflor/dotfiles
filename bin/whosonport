# This absurd "one-liner" will show you the name of the command running on each port on MacOS, which is something I need to do constantly so leaving it here:
sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P | awk 'NR>1 {print $9, $1, $2}' | sed 's/.*://' | while read port process pid; do echo "Port $port: $(ps -p $pid -o command= | sed 's/^-//') (PID: $pid)"; done | sort -n
